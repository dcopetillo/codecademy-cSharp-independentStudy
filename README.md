# Project 1: Console Creatures

C# can be used to make nearly anything – even creatures! This project was meant to use the Console.WriteLine() command to print text to the console and make ASCII creatures like this:

 .-.
(o o)
| O |
|   |
'~~~'

 
# Project 2: Mad Libs

In C#, variables and string interpolation allow us to transform a piece of text by swapping out different pieces of information.
In this project, I used C# to write a Mad Libs word game!

# Project 3: Money Maker

What is the minimum number of coins that equals 98 cents?

It’s a hard question to answer in your head, but it’s a fun problem to solve with programming. In this project I used C# to build a Money Maker program in which a user enters an amount and gets the minimum number of coins that equal that value.

# Project 4: Password Checker

In this project I made a program that measures the strength of any given password based on the following criteria. A strong password:

is at least 8 characters long
has lowercase letters
has uppercase letters
has numerical digits
has symbols, like #, ?, !

The program will ask the user to input a password, and using conditional logic and control flow, it will rate the password.

# Project 5: Choose Your Own Adventure

In this project, I used logic and conditional statements to write a classic text-based Choose Your Own Adventure Game. Depending on what choices your user makes, the program will have a different result. This was a highly useful project for my future endeavors with Unity, as control flow becomes a key part in game development as the principles of user input and control flow are used to build even highly advanced games.

# Project 6: Architect Arithmetic

In this project, I used methods to build a program that calculates the material cost for any architect’s floor plan. For example, the floor plan of the Pantheon in Rome, Italy.

# Project 7: Exquisite Corpse

In the game Exquisite Corpse, participants draw either a head, body, or feet of a creature. The players don’t know how their part of the body connects to the other two, until the drawing is finished and revealed.

For this project, I wrote a program that mimics the Exquisite Corpse game. Using methods, you’ll be able to randomly combine different parts of ASCII characters so they create a new creature

# Project 8: Caesar Cipher

For this project, I used methods to convert strings to arrays of characters and arrays of characters back to strings in order to create a function that uses Caesar's cipher to decode a coded phrase.

# Project 9: True of False

For this project, I used loops and arrays to repeat a question when a user inputs a true or false answer as something other than "true" or "false".

# Project 10: The Object of Your Affection

For this project, I created a function that allows a user to create a dating profile and interact with other user's profiles. The Profile class stores the following information:

User’s name
User’s age
User’s city
User’s country
User’s pronouns
User’s hobbies

Users should be able to interact with their own profiles in these ways:

Create a new profile with some information
Add hobbies
View profile
